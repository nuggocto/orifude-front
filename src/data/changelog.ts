          "Kept ambiguous mutation identifiers until their original operation is reconciled, and renewed suspended sessions against wall-clock deadlines.",
          "Restored persisted ASCII presentation, kept update notices visible, scoped reply drafts to one exchange, and hid actions the server would reject.",
          "Bound fold previews to the same stable seed stored by the post office and shown to recipients.",
          "Replaced the Windows metadata fallback with native file replacement and made the online recording wait on its actual database port and a dynamic HTTP port.",
          "Made ambiguous identity creation retryable and quittable without replacing its device key, and kept unconfirmed identities out of the offline branch after a restart.",
          "Kept empty online waits and repeated checks static on the branch screen, and made both owner-only file confirmation actions visible.",
          "Pinned third-party release and CI actions to reviewed commits, restricted tag publication to the current main-branch commit, and rejected incomplete or checksum-mismatched release matrices.",
