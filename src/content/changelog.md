# Changelog

Orifude has not published a puzzle-game release yet. This changelog begins with
the puzzle-game reboot; history from the retired letter-exchange application is
intentionally not included.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added native release archives for Linux x86_64 and ARM64, Intel and Apple
  Silicon macOS, and Windows x86_64, with fixed archive contents and SHA-256
  checksums.
- Added version-pinned POSIX and PowerShell installers, Homebrew, Scoop, and
  `orifude-bin` package metadata, and installation checks using the actual
  archived binaries.
- Added separate candidate and publication workflows, package-update dry runs,
  exact-commit release guards, and immutable-release verification before package
  publication.

- Defined Orifude as a native, keyboard-driven folding-and-ink puzzle that
  works fully offline and keeps progress on the player's computer.
- Recorded the canonical paper, fold, ink, target, undo, replay, scoring,
  storage, puzzle-pack, terminal, platform, security, and release contracts.
- Established a dependency-free Rust application with a pinned toolchain,
  locked builds, stable command-line exit statuses, help and version output,
  typed output errors, and unsafe code denied.
- Added reproducible mise tasks for formatting, linting, tests, documentation,
  release builds, dependency policy checks, the paper exercise, and paper-model
  measurements.
- Added read-only ordinary CI for pull requests and pushes to the permanent
  `shrek` branch, with pinned actions, bounded job time, and no publication
  credentials.
- Added a bounded dense paper model in which every physical cell keeps a stable
  identity, coordinate, layer, face, and orientation.
- Added centered vertical and horizontal fold prototypes in every direction,
  moved-layer reversal, dot stamping through a stack, exact target comparison,
  and complete undo snapshots.
- Added focused tests for construction, fold directions, layer order, empty
  destinations, ink comparison, failed-action immutability, action budgets,
  and exact undo restoration.
- Added six plain-text folding exercises and a release-mode measurement that
  compares the dense paper model with a coordinate-to-stack map.
- Added a model-driven walkthrough that shows a crease, the folded stack order,
  ink passing through both layers, and how to enter the predicted top cell
  before the player makes a prediction.
- Added validated puzzle identities, targets, allowed actions, budgets, and par
  as the construction boundary for playable paper.
- Added every bounded horizontal and vertical fold, dot and line brushes,
  atomic action rejection, reset, result scoring, and exact state keys.
- Added versioned bounded replays that bind to the exact validated gameplay
  revision, execute on fresh paper, and report failures without exposing
  partial state.
- Added exhaustive crease properties, fixed-seed action properties, and a
  dependency-free bounded domain-action fuzz harness.
- Added a deterministic solver with exact state keys, fold-first score order,
  independent visited-state, memory, depth, and cancellation limits, and
  production replay verification for every reported solution.
- Added versioned deterministic puzzle generation with injected calendar dates,
  bounded candidate attempts, validator and solver checks, reproducible failure
  seeds, and a preserved daily-output golden.
- Added solver and generator integration tests plus a release measurement for
  frontier memory, visited lookup cost, path restoration, and representative
  solved and unsolved puzzles.
- Added durable local SQLite settings, daily history, attempts, progress,
  bounded replays, best solutions, installed-pack metadata, and restart-safe
  migrations behind one process lock.
- Added versioned TOML pack and puzzle parsing, portable path validation,
  SHA-256 content fingerprints, bounded directory and ZIP installation,
  same-filesystem staging, interruption recovery, selected-pack verification,
  and progress-preserving removal.
- Added storage and malicious-pack integration tests, four bounded parser
  harnesses, and a release-mode durable-write measurement.
- Added concise play instructions to the README.
- Added a forty-paper handcrafted journey in eight teaching groups, with
  validator-checked solution witnesses and independently bounded solver paths.
- Added progressive home-branch states and a squirrel completion delivery when
  each five-paper group is finished.
- Added an installable three-paper example pack and a complete author guide for
  the local TOML format, validation, licensing, and contribution workflow.
- Added local `verify`, `solve`, and pack management commands with bounded,
  terminal-safe output and behavior tests through the shipped binary.
- Added a deterministic first-paper terminal recording for project and release
  documentation.

### Changed

- Reduced repeated cell scans in search and folded-paper drawing, skipped
  exhausted solver actions, and shared the validated journey catalog at startup.
- Expanded performance checks to populated player state, maximum-board fold
  and brush input, and a bounded 20,000-state search.

- Clarified that a moved stack may become the only stack at an empty destination
  inside the original bounded working area.
- Recorded the current direct-push policy for `shrek` while preserving the
  earlier protected-branch verification as dated history.
- Chose dense physical-cell storage and complete snapshots after measuring the
  rejected map-based representation and the maximum paper bounds.
- Moved the plain-text paper exercise onto the validated production domain API.
- Reused paper allocations during reset so bounded search can restore parent
  paths without rebuilding the canonical cell vector each time.
- Moved the built-in journey onto the same validated pack format used by
  community papers, keeping one parser and one gameplay boundary.
- Replaced the stale foundation README with current play, pack, and verification
  instructions.

### Fixed

- Compared saved scores within the same puzzle revision so solving revised
  content keeps its completion and best replay after restart.
- Synchronized event shutdown with queue waiters so a missed notification
  cannot leave an input thread waiting during exit.
- Validated ZIP catalogs before dependency parsing, rejected exact duplicate
  names, and prevented fallback to an unchecked catalog.
- Updated the pinned and minimum Rust compiler to 1.98.1 for its compiler
  correctness fix, and advanced the sanitizer nightly to support that minimum.
- Kept author-command tests inside their injected storage root on every
  supported operating system.
- Sanitized and bounded rejected pack paths and nested operational errors
  before they reach a terminal.
- Reconciled legacy community packs that claimed built-in identities and bound
  journey completion to the saved puzzle's exact gameplay definition.
- Kept older completed papers replayable after catalog growth, removed a stale
  group-completion card before replay, and made large result rows inspectable.
- Kept group lessons, branch progress, and compact headings readable at the
  supported terminal sizes.
- Aligned tutorial cues, author documentation, example-pack metadata, and the
  checked-in terminal recording with the shipped behavior.
- Made oversized paper-exercise input stop the session instead of allowing the
  unread tail to be interpreted as later commands.
- Kept deterministic generation trying its remaining bounded candidates after
  one candidate exhausts the solver.
- Rejected generator pack IDs and rule lists at configuration construction,
  before the generator retains or copies them.
- Removed a redundant invariant scan before in-place paper reset while keeping
  the rebuilt state checked before reset returns.
- Preserved protected completion state inside the SQLite reserve while dropping
  only nonessential replay history when space is tight.
- Recovered spilled rollback journals before schema checks and kept the original
  installation timestamp when a pending pack completes after restart.
- Collected independent puzzle errors in one bounded report without allocating
  diagnostics beyond the 32-issue limit.
- Reconciled missing registered pack directories and unknown managed entries so
  interrupted or platform-created filesystem state cannot block every startup.
- Kept zero-progress branch copy from claiming the first group gift.
- Rejected undeclared fields inside nested brush and recorded-solution tables.

### Security

- Bounded command-line parsing, diagnostic cause traversal, paper dimensions,
  physical cells, actions, history, scratch storage, and exercise input.
- Prevented command-line arguments and paper-exercise input from being echoed
  into terminal output.
- Added locked advisory, license, and dependency-source checks to the ordinary
  repository check.
- Rejected pack traversal, absolute and reserved paths, links, special files,
  unsupported compression, terminal controls, invalid SPDX expressions, and
  every declared file, count, depth, and size excess before installation.
- Rejected a symlinked managed-pack root before orphan cleanup can touch content
  outside Orifude's private data directory.
- Kept SQLite main-file, reserve, replay-history, transient-journal, pack-count,
  and managed-content growth within explicit hard bounds.
